# Write a script that prompts the user for a name (this input will be a 1 word string). 
# Using a while loop that counts downwards, print the letters of the name reversed 
# (hint: you can use print(var, end='') in each iteration of the loop). 

# You cannot use the 'reverse' function or the string slicing [::-1] method for this problem! 

# You should use s.lower() and s.upper(), as appropriate, 

# Enter your name: ANA
# Ana
# Palindrome!to change the string to lowercase and print it out with only the first letter of the reversed word in uppercase. 

# If the name is the same forward and backwards, print "Palindrome!" on the next line. 

# Make sure your code prints the sample examples exactly as shown below.

# Hint: You can use string concatenation in place of the reverse or string slicing [::-1] methods.

# Examples:

# Enter your name: Paul
# Luap
