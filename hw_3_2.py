# Write code that asks the user for a text string including the four numbers, a, b, c, and d, separated by spaces. You can use the split() method on the string to create a list of the four values in order.

# Create a tuple that represents each row, then create a tuple that contains those two tuples. It should have the form ((a, b), (c, d)). Print this representation.
# Recall that multiplying a matrix by a number effectively multiplies each element of the matrix by that number.

# Compute the inverse of the given matrix, again represented as nested tuples, use fstring formatting to show each number to 4 decimal places and print this representation. Use the example below to make sure you understand the equation correctly:

# An example on fstring formatting:

# print(f'matrix: (({a:.4f}, {b:.4f}), ({c:.4f}, {d:.4f}))')"

# Please enter four numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4

# matrix: ((1.0000, 2.0000), (3.0000, 4.0000))
# inverse: ((-2.0000, 1.0000), (1.5000, -0.5000))
